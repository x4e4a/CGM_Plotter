# CGM_Plotter

Recently (Summmer of 2022) subscribed to the LEVELs Service and I love it. 

LEVELS uses the Dexcom G6 to monitor blood glucose levels throughout the day in 5 minute intervals. LEVELS does a great job of downloading the data, journaling meals and exercises to provide insight to how food and activity influence blood glucose levels. 

That said, I wanted to pull the data down and plot it myself as well. 

If you are diabetic or pre-diabetic or just curious about how food effects your blood glucose levels, I highly recommend LEVELs and the Dexcom G6.
